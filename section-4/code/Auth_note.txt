1. Install required library flask-JWT
2. JWT(json web token), encoding data (encrept )
3. inorder to encrept and be吃ha able to understand what we encrept is we need a key


JWT (https://auth0.com/docs/jwt)

What is a JSON Web Token(JWT)?
	1. Based on Web Standard (RFC7591)
	2. Used to securely communicate JSON objects
	3. Consist of a header, payload and signature
	4. Self-contained

	The JWT header:
	The header is a JSON object usually consisting of the type(typ), which is JWT and the algorithim used for encrypting the JWT(alg)
	{
		"typ":"JWT",
		"alg":"HS256"
	}

	The JWT payload:
	The payload is a JSON object that consists of user-defined attributes (called public claims). Some attributes are defined in the standard 
	(these are called reserved claims)
	{
		"iss": "http://myapi.com", #reserved claim
		"user": "nodebotanist" # public claim
	}

	The JWT Signature 
	The signature is the encoded header and payload, signed with a secret.
	HMACSHA256(
		base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret
	)

	The JWT signature
	This accomplishes serveral tasks at once, including:
		-> Proves the identity of the sender
		-> Ensures the message has not changed

	The JWT Token
	A finished token looks like [encodeed header].[encoded payload].[signature]

What's the advantage?
	Because we are using JSON instead of XML
	-> Compact
	-> Easy to sign
	-> Easy to parse

How do I use JWTs in my API?
