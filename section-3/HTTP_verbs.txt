What is web server?

	A piece of software designed to accept incomming web requests
	For example, Google has many web servers
	When we go to http://www.google.com in our browser, we send something to a web server

What do we send?

	When you go to http://www.google.com, you send the following:

		GET / HTTP/1.1
		HOST: www.google.com

A Get requset

	The server then sees GET / HTTP/1/1
	                 (verb)(Path)(Protocol)
	That's it!

	The server sees that, and then there's code

	The code may interpert the GET request in many differents ways


For example:
	
	It may give you an error, if is not found
	It may give you an error, if HTTP is not suppported
	It may give you an error, if the server is unavailable
	It may give you HTML code back (which is what it normally does)
	It may give you some text back
	It may give you nothing back

What else?

	Going to any page in your browserwill do the same

		GET /login HTTP/1.1
		Host: https://twitter.com

	Going to a page will always do a GET

	But there are many other things we can do, such as POST, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD, and much more

	Each server responds differently to each, but they normally have the same meaning in each

Differences

	The only difference is what the server on the other end responds with 
	Twitter responds with the Twitter HTML
	Google responds with the Google HTML

HTTP Verbs

	GET    Retrieve somrthing
	POST    Receive data, and use it
	PUT    Make sure something is there
	DELETE    Removing something
