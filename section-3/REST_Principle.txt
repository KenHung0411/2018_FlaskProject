What is a REST API?
	It's a way of thinking about how a web server responds to your requests
	It doesn't respond with just data
	It responds with resources

Resources
	Similar to Object-Oriented programming
	Think of the server as having resources, and eaach is able to interact with the pertinent request

		Item resource
			GET /item/chair
			POST /item/chair 
			...

		ItemList resource
			GET /items

Stateless
	Another key feature is that REST is supposed to be stateless
	This means one request cannot depend on any other requests
	The server only knows about the current requests and not any previous requests

	For example:

		POST /item/chair creates an item
		The server doesn't know the item now exists
		GET /item/chair then goes to the database and checks to see if the item is there
		To get an item you don't need to have creayed an item before - the item could be in the database form previously

	Another example:

		A user logs into a web application 
		The web server doesn't know the user is logged in (since it does not remeber any state)
		What do we do?
		The web application must send enough data to identify the user in every request, or else the server won't associate the request with the user
